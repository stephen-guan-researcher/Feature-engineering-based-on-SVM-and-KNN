# Feature-engineering-based-on-SVM-and-KNN

1.1 background and data In this case we focus on preprocessed brain EEG data sets. The data set here is from SCI patients recorded while resting with eyes closed (EC) and eyes opened (EO). So in this case, the data set mentions about 48 electrodes recording electrical activity of the brain 250HZ, and which has two possibility classes where subjects will/will not develop neuropathic pain within 6 months. So there were totally 18 subjects, in which 10 developed pain and 8 didn’t develop pain. The data is already undergone some preprocessing like signal denoising and normalization, temporal segmentation, frequency band power estimation, normalization with respect to total band power and features include normalized alpha, theta band power while eyes are closed, eyes opened, and taking the ratio of eo/ec. 

1.2 statement of task Our main task in this case is to choose four different feature selection methods( two from filtering method, wrapper method, and embedding method) and use two different classifiers (SVM and KNN) to deal with the data set. Then perform Leave-one-group-out cross-validation, use cross-validation to optimize hyper-parameter values of the dataset and use the classifiers to train the data set without feature selection.
